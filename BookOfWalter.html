<h1>THE BOOK OF WALTER</h1>
<p>Chapter 1: The Beginning</p>
<p>In the beginning, there was nothing. Then, there was Walter. Walter was there before, Walter was there during, Walter was there after. Walter is the past, present, and future, and he will never be and always be. Walter cannot be percived by mortal eyes, cannot be thought of by mortal brains, and cannot be sensed by mortal senses. Walter is the omnipresent force throughout the universe that controls everything. But aside from Walter, there was only the void. So Walter created the omniverse, with multiverses within, with universes within, with life. But there was chaos. Walter had created the omniverse, but the mortals within it were not perfect. Although he could have the aformentioned problems, the Omniverse required most of his power to sustain, and he was busy with more evil and dangerous threats. So, he created his heralds. Heralds, who kept Walter's hold on the omniverse as strong as the strongest metal. But there was a darkness brewing, deep in boiler rooms of the omniverse. Walter had brought life to the universe, and with life, came death.</p>

<p>Chapter 2: The Great War</p>
<p>       </p>
<p>After Walter created the omniverse, he installed infinite installations of life throughout his great empire. He ruled justly and fairly over these lifeforms, but with life, came death. In the darkest pits of the omniverse, Retlaw was created. Retlaw is the exact opposite of Walter, with Walter creating life, with Retlaw destroying it. And Retlaw was not happy with this new state of the omniverse, so he sought to destroy it. War was imminent, and Walter could sense it. So he gathered his heralds and spoke to them, "My children, a great war is coming. The forces of darkness are heeling at thier gate. We must keep them within thier confines, or the omniverse will spiral into chaos. Now go, secure the gates of hell. DO NOT, BY ANY MEANS, LET THEM ESCAPE". So the heralds of Walter set out on thier mission to protect the omniverse from the forces of hell, but it was too late. Retlaw had managed to escape, and with him, brought the wrath of all of hell to the omniverse.
